# Overview {#overview}

## The challenge {#the-challenge}

With the current changes in the United States government and the corporate world's shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), accessibility has been caught in the political crossfire. 

Because many of the most-used arguments for accessibility rely on principles like DEI, it’s easy to think that the practice of digital accessibility itself is in danger.

## Our mission {#our-mission}

Our mission is to provide a survival kit with a broader set of arguments to make a solid case for digital accessibility. Its goal is to expand a practitioner’s repertoire to include arguments in favor of accessibility that transcend the winds of legal and political change.

By making these arguments available to anyone, we hope to reframe accessibility as a practice based on common sense and the pursuit of usability, quality, and safety that provides autonomy for people with disabilities and increased usability for everyone.

## What is accessibility {#what-is-accessibility}

For purposes of this document, we define accessibility as: the ability of as many people as possible to access goods and services as efficiently and independently as possible. While we focus on digital accessibility, or the accessibility of things that come to us electronically, many of these arguments can be applied to other categories of accessibility as well.

## People with disabilities have significant buying power. {#people-with-disabilities-have-significant-buying-power.}

According to a [2018 report](https://www.air.org/resource/report/hidden-market-purchasing-power-working-age-adults-disabilities), approximately 20 million working-age adults with disabilities collectively earn an annual disposable income of $490 billion. 

Note: This figure does not include the buying power of retirees through income or assets. Adults over 65 have a more than even chance of having a disability, and they own an estimated 70% of private assets in the US.

As the population trends older, we project that the buying power of people with disabilities will increase relative to the rest of the population.

## People with disabilities are far more likely to purchase from companies that take their needs into account. {#people-with-disabilities-are-far-more-likely-to-purchase-from-companies-that-take-their-needs-into-account.}

People with Disabilities are far more likely to purchase from an accessible company. It’s faster and more convenient, and they don’t need to seek assistance to make a purchase.

The frustration caused by the lack of accessibility has caused many disabled persons to abandon a purchase halfway through.

## Accessibility challenges lead to abandoned shopping carts. {#accessibility-challenges-lead-to-abandoned-shopping-carts.}

A 2021 study in the UK found that 43% of disabled consumers abandoned shopping tasks without completing their purchases as the result of limited choices and feelings of disempowerment.

#### **What disabled consumers choose to buy and why**

*Business Disability Forum*  
Disabled consumers across the UK experience limited choice and feelings of disempowerment when purchasing products, services, and activities, resulting in over 43 percent abandoning shopping tasks without purchasing.

## People with disabilities often influence the purchasing decisions of friends and family. {#people-with-disabilities-often-influence-the-purchasing-decisions-of-friends-and-family.}

Especially in hospitality, accessibility barriers impact everyone in a group. If there is one person with a disability in a group, they are likely to all leave if the experience is inaccessible. They don’t want their friend or loved ones to be left out.

When a business is inaccessible, people with disabilities often influence family and friends to avoid it.

#### **People With Disabilities Living In The US Face Urgent Barriers To Housing**

Urban Institute  
An analysis of the US Census Bureau’s 2021 Current Population Survey data suggests that people with disabilities are more likely to be heads of households than abled people. Most people with disabilities (58 percent) are heads of their households, while 47 percent of nondisabled people are heads of their households.  
\[https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/People%20with%20Disabilities%20Living%20in%20the%20US%20Face%20Urgent%20Barriers%20to%20Housing\_0.pdf\]

## An accessible business is a user-friendly business {#an-accessible-business-is-a-user-friendly-business}

Among user experience (UX) professionals, it’s a fundamental fact that accessibility practices we teach also improve the overall user experience for everyone.

# Accessibility is quality. {#accessibility-is-quality.}

When digital products are designed with the user in mind, they’re more usable and perceived to be of better quality and greater value.

## Inaccessible products are of lower quality and don’t reflect well on their makers. {#inaccessible-products-are-of-lower-quality-and-don’t-reflect-well-on-their-makers.}

Because accessibility is primarily a quality issue, a lack of accessibility suggests poor workmanship or a lack of concern for quality.

In the near future, digital products will need to be accessible to be competitive.

## In 2025, Accessibility will become a mandatory quality standard for selling digital products in Europe. {#in-2025,-accessibility-will-become-a-mandatory-quality-standard-for-selling-digital-products-in-europe.}

In addition, a set of new statutes under the European Union’s EAA will mandate accessibility. By ignoring European accessibility statutes, American software manufacturers may become less competitive against other manufacturers from other countries. 

An American software manufacturer publishing inaccessible apps could be shut out of the European versions of the App Store and Google Apps.

# The moral case:  {#the-moral-case:}

# Accessibility is the right thing to do. {#accessibility-is-the-right-thing-to-do.}

## Most of us still believe that people with disabilities should have equal access to goods and services. {#most-of-us-still-believe-that-people-with-disabilities-should-have-equal-access-to-goods-and-services.}

Despite the backlash against DEI, a significant majority of people still believe that people with disabilities should have equal access to goods and services.

Accessibility is seen by many as separate from the DEI policies they oppose.

## Accessible businesses earn reputations for being socially conscious. {#accessible-businesses-earn-reputations-for-being-socially-conscious.}

Accessible businesses earn a reputation for being socially conscious, which is still important to many, particularly millennials.

 

# Disabled people are a valuable resource. {#disabled-people-are-a-valuable-resource.}

## Most employers underestimate the capabilities of people with disabilities. {#most-employers-underestimate-the-capabilities-of-people-with-disabilities.}

People with disabilities are more capable than most people think.

Given proper training and an accessible environment, most people with disabilities can perform most jobs comparable to those without.

## People with disabilities are often better problem solvers. {#people-with-disabilities-are-often-better-problem-solvers.}

People with disabilities bring benefits to the team, such as resilience and superior problem-solving skills.

The lack of accessibility they often have to overcome forces people with disabilities to be resilient and creative in finding workarounds to everyday barriers.

## People with disabilities tend to be extra loyal to companies that give them a chance.  {#people-with-disabilities-tend-to-be-extra-loyal-to-companies-that-give-them-a-chance.}

Disabled employees are far less likely to jump from job to job, favoring long-term security instead.

# The social model, updated {#the-social-model,-updated}

## Accessibility barriers disable people more than physical conditions.  {#accessibility-barriers-disable-people-more-than-physical-conditions.}

In the 1980s, a group of British disability activists stated that it is society that disables people. The world is built and designed for abled people, and thus the limitations on disabled people’s abilities to perform everyday activities come from the built environment and societal systems.

With the coming of the internet, software in the workplace, and personal devices, it’s become clear that the digital world also creates new barriers. 

## In a barrier-free world, disabled people would need little or no assistance. {#in-a-barrier-free-world,-disabled-people-would-need-little-or-no-assistance.}

With access to environments, vehicles, software, and digital experiences that work for them, people with disabilities would enjoy greater autonomy to perform everyday activities.

## Fewer barriers and more autonomy lead to greater employability. {#fewer-barriers-and-more-autonomy-lead-to-greater-employability.}

As barriers to workplace activities diminish, people with disabilities will be able to participate more with their abled counterparts and have equal footing in the workplace. 

## Accessibility reduces dependence on social welfare programs. {#accessibility-reduces-dependence-on-social-welfare-programs.}

With greater access to jobs, people with disabilities will be able to enjoy more economic autonomy. As a result, fewer will need supplemental income and other publicly-funded assistance.

## Accessibility reduces the burden on customer service. {#accessibility-reduces-the-burden-on-customer-service.}

Accessibility allows people with disabilities to self-service, resulting in far fewer resources being dedicated to helping them with basic tasks.

*AEL Data Services*  
Providing aid and support to consumers is crucial for a successful organization. To ensure the accessibility of customer service, firms must lower barriers and cater to diverse individual requirements.

## Accessibility reduces the burden on family and friends. {#accessibility-reduces-the-burden-on-family-and-friends.}

People with disabilities, given an accessible environment, are far less likely to seek the assistance of family and friends when performing day-to-day tasks.

# Legal reasons to conform to accessibility standards {#legal-reasons-to-conform-to-accessibility-standards}

In the United States, accessibility is a protected right covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and some state laws, such as the Unruh Civil Rights Act of California.

For that reason, an accessibility lawsuit is handled as a civil rights case

## Settling a digital accessibility complaint is costly. {#settling-a-digital-accessibility-complaint-is-costly.}

An [analysis from 2019](https://www.deque.com/blog/the-business-case-for-accessibility/) estimated that it would cost a major business over $350,000 in legal representation at $250/hour to respond to an accessibility lawsuit, in addition to the actual amount of the the settlement.

Even if your organization is not in the Fortune 500, a single accessibility lawsuit can cost tens or hundreds of thousands to defend. 

## Defending a digital accessibility suit is unlikely to succeed. {#defending-a-digital-accessibility-suit-is-unlikely-to-succeed.}

Only a handful of accessibility lawsuits have been litigated in favor of the party being sued, typically at a cost of millions in legal fees.

## An accessibility settlement with one party is no protection from an accessibility lawsuit from another party. {#an-accessibility-settlement-with-one-party-is-no-protection-from-an-accessibility-lawsuit-from-another-party.}

Most accessibility settlements include a promise from the defendant to fix accessibility issues within a generous time period, typically 12 months. It’s not a grace period, though. If the issues persist, then other plaintiffs can sue even during the time established in the settlement.

## Accessibility is still the law of the land.  {#accessibility-is-still-the-law-of-the-land.}

Even if the executive branch of the US government selectively enforces existing law or not at all, accessibility laws still apply to private parties as well as state and local governments.

## Here are the laws that apply in the United States: {#here-are-the-laws-that-apply-in-the-united-states:}

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990)

Title II of the ADA requires that public accommodations such as entrances, elevators, restrooms, and other facilities be physically accessible. Most courts agree that the ADA also applies to digital accommodations such as websites, especially if they are for a physical brick-and-mortar business.  
\[https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/regulations/title-iii-regulations/\]

### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) (2010)

The CVAA requires that telecommunications companies, TV broadcasters, and online media providers ensure that modern communications (smartphones, video calls, streaming services, etc.) are accessible.  
\[https://www.fcc.gov/cvaa\]

Specifically, the CVAA requires closed captioning on TV and online video content among other accommodations.

### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) (1986)

All U.S. and foreign airlines operating in the U.S. are required to provide wheelchair access, onboard accommodations, and accessible communications.

### Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (1973)

Organizations that receive federal funding, such as schools, hospitals, and public programs are required to ensure equal access to services, programs, and activities for people with disabilities. Section 504 covers physical and digital access, including websites and online resources.

### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (1998 Update)

Federal agencies and any organizations that receive federal contracts or funding are required to ensure Digital and IT accessibility for federal websites, software, and electronic content. Section 508 specifically calls for conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines for web accessibility.

### State-Specific Laws

Some states have their own accessibility laws that go beyond federal regulations. California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act and New York’s Digital Accessibility Laws are two examples.

## The clock is ticking if you are a city, town, or public entity. {#the-clock-is-ticking-if-you-are-a-city,-town,-or-public-entity.}

The latest ADA Title II ruling by the US Department of Justice sets a timetable for state and local governments and their entities to comply with web accessibility standards. If the jurisdiction is larger than 50,000 people, the deadline is April 24, 2026\. If it’s smaller, then the deadline is one year later, or April 24, 2027\.

# Newer arguments {#newer-arguments}

Less-used or new talking points that haven’t been prominently published.

## Accessibility is personalization. {#accessibility-is-personalization.}

For decades, device manufacturers have included technologies that allow for this level of personalization, such as text resizing, dark mode, and voice commands. If you’re an abled person, these forms of personalization are helpful, but if you have a disability, they’re essential to your ability to perform everyday tasks.

Out of neglect, software creators and website developers will often build products in ways that don’t play nicely with assistive technologies. Digital accessibility professionals are devoted to ensuring that products meet basic standards of quality and compatibility to make their content work with our needs and preferences.

## Accessibility asserts your right to personalization. {#accessibility-asserts-your-right-to-personalization.}

In the same way that I, as a car owner, can set up my preferences for my seat position, cabin temperature, mirrors, and radio stations, I should be able to define how my digital devices work for me.

## Accessibility is a requirement in other parts of the world. {#accessibility-is-a-requirement-in-other-parts-of-the-world.}

When you do business internationally, you are bound by international laws.

The European AI Act is in some ways stricter than our federal laws.
