              <p>Note: This figure does not include the buying power of retirees through income or assets. Adults over 65 have a more than even chance of having a disability, and they own an estimated 70% of private assets in the US.</p>
              <p>As the population trends older, we project that the buying power of people with disabilities will increase relative to the rest of the population.</p>
