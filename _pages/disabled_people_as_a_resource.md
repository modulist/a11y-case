# Disabled people as a resource

People with disabilities bring benefits to the team, such as resilience and superior problem-solving skills.

The lack of accessibility they often have to overcome forces people with disabilities to be resilient and creative in finding workarounds to everyday barriers.

Disabled employees are far less likely to jump from job to job, favoring long-term security instead.
