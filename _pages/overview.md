## The challenge


With the current changes in the United States government and the corporate world's shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), accessibility has been caught in the political crossfire. 


Because many of the most-used arguments for accessibility rely on principles like DEI, it’s easy to think that the practice of digital accessibility itself is in danger.


## Our mission


Our mission is to provide a survival kit in the form of a broader set of arguments to make a solid case for digital accessibility. Its goal is to expand a practitioner’s repertoire to include arguments in favor of accessibility that transcend the winds of legal and political change.


By making these arguments available to anyone, we hope to reframe accessibility as a practice based on common sense and the pursuit of usability, quality, and safety that provides autonomy for people with disabilities and increased usability for everyone.


## What is accessibility


For purposes of this document, we are defining accessibility as: the ability of as many people as possible to access goods and services as efficiently and independently as possible. While we focus on digital accessibility, or the accessibility of things which come to us electronically, many of these arguments can be applied to other categories of accessibility as well.
