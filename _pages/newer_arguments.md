### Accessibility is personalization.
For decades, device manufacturers have included technologies that allow for this level of personalization, such as text resizing, dark mode, and voice commands. If you’re an abled person, these forms of personalization are helpful, but if you have a disability, they’re essential to your ability to perform everyday tasks.

Out of neglect, software creators and website developers will often build products in ways that don’t play nicely with assistive technologies. Digital accessibility professionals are devoted to ensuring that products meet basic standards of quality and compatibility to make their content work with our needs and preferences.


## Accessibility asserts your right to personalization
In the same way that I, as a car owner, can set up my preferences for my seat position, cabin temperature, mirrors, and radio stations, I should be able to define how my digital devices work for me.


## Accessibility is a requirement in other parts of the world.
When you do business internationally, you are bound by international laws.

The European AI Act is in some ways stricter than our federal laws.
