# An accessible business is a prosperous business

## People with disabilities have significant buying power.
According to a [2018 report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.air.org/resource/report/hidden-market-purchasing-power-working-age-adults-disabilities&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1742577216121284&usg=AOvVaw3W5_538uaWIzwNifpHv6gd), approximately 20 million working-age adults with disabilities collectively earn an annual disposable income of $490 billion. 


Note: This figure does not include the buying power of retirees through income or assets. Adults over 65 have a more than even chance of having a disability, and they own an estimated 70% of private assets in the US.


As the population trends older, we project that the buying power of people with disabilities will increase relative to the rest of the population.

## People with disabilities are far more likely to purchase from companies that take their needs into account.
People with Disabilities are far more likely to purchase from an accessible company. It is faster, more convenient, and they don’t need to seek assistance to make a purchase.


        The frustration caused by lack of accessibility has caused many a disabled person to abandon a purchase halfway through.


## People with disabilities often influence the purchasing decisions of friends and family.
Especially in hospitality, accessibility barriers impact everyone in a group. If there is one person with a disability in a group, they are likely to all leave if the experience is inaccessible. They don’t want their friend or loved one to be left out.

When a business is inaccessible, people with disabilities often influence family and friends to avoid it. 


## An accessible business is a user-friendly business
Many of the accessibility practices we teach also improve the overall user experience.
