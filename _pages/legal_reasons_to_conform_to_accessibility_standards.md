# Legal reasons to conform to accessibility standards


In the United States, accessibility is a protected right covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and some state laws such as the Unruh Civil Rights Act of California.


For that reason, an accessibility lawsuit is handled as a civil rights case



## Settling a digital accessibility complaint is costly.


An [analysis from 2019](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deque.com/blog/the-business-case-for-accessibility/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1742577216130911&usg=AOvVaw10sRsmZARzGHoFd1x33SG5) estimated that it would cost a major business over $350,000 in legal representation at $250/hour to respond to an accessibility lawsuit, in addition to the actual amount of the the settlement.


Even if your organization is not in the Fortune 500, a single accessibility lawsuit can cost tens or hundreds of thousands to defend. 


## Defending a digital accessibility suit is unlikely to succeed.


Only a handful of accessibility lawsuits have been litigated in favor of the party being sued, typically at a cost of millions in legal fees.


## An accessibility settlement with one party is no protection from an accessibility lawsuit from another party.


Most accessibility settlements include a promise from the defendant to fix accessibility issues within a generous time period, typically 12 months. It’s not a grace period, though. If the issues persist, then other plaintiffs can sue even during the time established in the settlement.


## Accessibility is still the law of the land.


Even if the executive branch of the US government selectively enforces existing law or not at all, accessibility laws still apply to private parties as well as state and local governments.

## Here are the laws that apply in the United States:


### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990)


Title II of the ADA requires that public accommodations such as entrances, elevators, restrooms, and other facilities be physically accessible. Most courts agree that the ADA also applies to digital accommodations such as websites, especially if they are for a physical brick-and-mortar business.


### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) (2010)


The CVAA requires that telecommunications companies, TV broadcasters, and online media providers ensure that modern communications (smartphones, video calls, streaming services, etc.) are accessible.


Specifically, the CVAA requires closed captioning on TV and online video content among other accommodations.


### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) (1986)


All U.S. and foreign airlines operating in the U.S. are required to provide wheelchair access, onboard accommodations, and accessible communications.


### Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (1973)


Organizations that receive federal funding, such as schools, hospitals, and public programs are required to ensure equal access to services, programs, and activities for people with disabilities. Section 504 covers physical and digital access, including websites and online resources.


### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (1998 Update)


Federal agencies and any organizations that receive federal contracts or funding are required to ensure Digital and IT accessibility for federal websites, software, and electronic content. Section 508 specifically calls for conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines for web accessibility.


### State-Specific Laws


Some states have their own accessibility laws that go beyond federal regulations. California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act and New York’s Digital Accessibility Laws are two examples.
