# An accessible business is a prosperous business

## People with disabilities have significant buying power.
According to a [2018 report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.air.org/resource/report/hidden-market-purchasing-power-working-age-adults-disabilities&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1742577216121284&usg=AOvVaw3W5_538uaWIzwNifpHv6gd), approximately 20 million working-age adults with disabilities collectively earn an annual disposable income of $490 billion. 


Note: This figure does not include the buying power of retirees through income or assets. Adults over 65 have a more than even chance of having a disability, and they own an estimated 70% of private assets in the US.


As the population trends older, we project that the buying power of people with disabilities will increase relative to the rest of the population.

## People with disabilities often influence the purchasing decisions of friends and family.
Especially in hospitality, accessibility barriers impact everyone in a group. If there is one person with a disability in a group, they are likely to all leave if the experience is inaccessible. They don’t want their friend or loved ones to be left out.

When a business is inaccessible, people with disabilities often influence family and friends to avoid it.
