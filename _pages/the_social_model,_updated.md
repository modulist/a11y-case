## Accessibility barriers disable people more than physical conditions.


In the 1980s, a group of British disability activists stated that it is society that disables people. The world is built and designed for abled people, and thus the limitations on disabled people’s abilities to perform everyday activities comes from the built environment, and societal systems.


With the coming of the internet, software in the workplace, and personal devices, it’s become clear that the digital world also creates new barriers. 


## In a barrier-free world, disabled people would need little or no assistance.


With access to environments, vehicles, software, and digital experiences that work for them, people with disabilities would enjoy greater autonomy to perform everyday activities.


## Fewer barriers and more autonomy lead to greater employability.


As barriers to workplace activities diminish, people with disabilities will be able to participate more with their abled counterparts and have equal footing in the workplace. 


## Accessibility reduces dependence on social welfare programs.


With greater access to jobs, people with disabilities will be able to enjoy more economic autonomy. As a result, fewer will need supplemental income and other publicly-funded assistance.

## Accessibility reduces the burden on customer service.


Accessibility allows people with disabilities to self-service, resulting in far fewer resources being dedicated to helping them with basic tasks.


## Accessibility reduces the burden on family and friends.


People with disabilities, given an accessible environment, are far less likely to seek the assistance of family and friends when performing day to day tasks.
